# Google-Copy
My attempt at recreating Google!

### What is this project? 
This was a project made for CS50w, where i had to recreate the main Google funcionalities: Google Search, Google Images and some of Google Advanced Search.

You can check out the problem set [HERE](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/)!

Also, if you want to see the project working, there is a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_cQKAPZJwI)!

### Files
#### index.html
It is the Google Search page. It has both the usual search button, aswell as the "I'm feeling lucky" button.
#### googleImages.html
The Google Images search page.
#### advancedSearch
Google advanced search options, but i've recreated only the first four: "all these words", "this exact word or phrase", "any of these words", "none of these words".

### Some considerations
This was a fairly simple project. It uses only HTML and CSS, and i've used query strings for the search functionalities.
